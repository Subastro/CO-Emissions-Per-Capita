This project visualizes the annual CO₂ emissions per capita for China, the USA, and the UK from 1750 to 2023, using line plots to analyze emission trends over time.

**Project Overview**
The goal is to:
- Compare historical CO₂ emissions between three major countries.
- Analyze growth patterns and industrial impact on emissions.

**Data Source**
The dataset used is from Our World in Data, downloaded as per-capita-co-emissions.csv.

**The chart compares emissions among:**
- USA (since ~1800)
- UK (since 1750)
- China (since 1907)

**Insights**
- The UK was an early emitter due to industrialization.
- The USA saw steep growth post-1900.
- China's emissions rose significantly after the 2000s.
